  <h1 class="title">A Guide to Advanced React Component Architecture</h1>

    I came up with this idea after building a very complicated private data
    search portal from scratch at Digital Infuzion. And then building a very
    similar page again for another site. Essentially, the issue that I ran into
    is that I was struggling to pass state around a page where elements that all
    cared about the same state were located on multiple levels of the component
    tree. For example, there were filters on one side of the page that used the
    same state as chips located on another side, under a different div in a flex
    container. So it was the HTML that made my components messy and complicated
    to reason about since I had HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic all bundled
    together.
  </p>
  <p>
    I already had heard about "lifting state up" and tried to do that as much as
    possible, but it only started to click when I realized I could utilize the
    children prop to extract my HTML/CSS into "Container" components, i. e.
    components that strictly add shape and style to the page, but only consume
    state and never create their own state.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was at around this point I started rewriting a lot of my most complicated
    React logic utilizing the style that I will outline in this post.
  </p>
  <p>
    I made an example project that represents the ideas of this pattern called
    either card-deck or ReactCasino on
    <a href="https://github.com/MikeBarberry/carddeck">GitHub</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    And it is deployed on the Internet with
    <a href="https://reactcasino.netlify.app/">Netlify</a>.

    Okay grab a coffee, (and read this 7 times). There is a lot of information
    coming. If implemented, it can radically transform your approach to building
    complex front-ends with React. However, I realize that it can be a bit hard
    to grasp.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will be using renderProps, "lifting state up" the children prop, Context,
    wrapper components, a primary component, and container components.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, take a look again at the cover photo and take a minute or two to
    consider how you would implement this in React. (I use hooks and will only
    cover hooks in this article.)
  </p>

  </div>
  <p>
    (For those curious, there are more cards on the page beneath the 5 visible
    cards. A total of 10 have been drawn.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to discovering this method, which doesn't really have a proper name,
    but could be called "moving state out" as an homage to "lifting state up"
    (although more than just state is moved out; it more literally alters the
    structural organization of state and HTML on a React webpage), I would have
    probably wrote a Casino component that renders a div with left and right
    side component children. So something maybe called "Deck" for the left and
    "Cards" for the right. I would probably define Casino in Casino.js and have
    Deck.js and Cards.js files. The left and right side components would
    probably do something similar to the root component, and so on...

  <p>The Cards component might look something like:</p>
  <div class="image">

      height="260"

    <p id="caption">Example Cards Component</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    What we will do is dramatically different. To me, the above is difficult to
    read. Yet this pattern is common in React code. And for a while, I wrote my
    React code this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not aware of any other blog posts or articles on the Internet that
    describe this as a development pattern. Although I do know that parts of it
    are used all of the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    What follows is a structural approach to designing the architecture of React
    webpages. "Webpages" is significant here. These are the basic until of
    fundamental organizational structure on the front-end. Routers that are used
    with React typically render a single component as a representation of a
    page. SPA React typically uses react-router-dom that conditionally renders a
    specific component based on the route in the browser URL. NextJS SSR React
    builds single HTML files per page (more like traditional web servers
    pre-SPA). In both cases the page is the fundamental unit of organization.
    This is where our story starts. What we are trying to do is create a webpage
    where the code is legible and can be easily digested. We are trying to be
    able to keep a clear mental picture of what is happening so we can handle
    complex situations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of writing our Cards logic like that, we are going to write it like
    this:
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/reactcasino/3.png"
      height="765"
      width="432"
      alt="reactcasino 3" />
    <p id="caption">
      Various components that collectively render cards with conditional logic
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>And it is returned from a single component like this:</p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/reactcasino/4.png"
      height="385"
      width="432"
      alt="reactcasino 4" />
    <p id="caption">Root component rendering the Cards components</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    One component we haven't seen the code for yet is the CardsContainer. It
    looks like:
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/reactcasino/5.png"
      height="325"
      width="432"
      alt="reactcasino 5" />
    <p id="caption">
      Component containing the HTML logic for the Cards (right) side of the page
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>These are the main principles of this architectural philosophy.</p>
  <p>The deck side looks like:</p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/reactcasino/6.png"
      height="337"
      width="432"
      alt="reactcasino 6" />
    <p id="caption">Deck side (left) rendered in the root component</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The Deck side of the page follows the same principles as the Cards side
    does. They are both wrapped in a single page level container that provides a
    flex div with various settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Importantly, this approach allows all of the components that will be used on
    a page to be rendered in a single component. No more chasing import
    statements in multiple files to figure out where a piece of state comes
    from, for example. There is no need for prop-drilling because the entire
    structure is rendered in a single tree that mirrors the DOM tree.
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/reactcasino/7.png"
      height="64"
      width="369"
      alt="reactcasino 7" />
    <p id="caption">Rendered DOM of Casino (root) component</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    There is also no need for a global store like Redux to manage page state.
    Redux is often reached to to handle complex state management, even on a
    single page, to remove the logic from the main components and put them into
    a store with actions, reducers, etc. However, that adds additional tech debt
    and cognitive load, as these are entire additional structures that must be
    maintained and extended by developers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The approach outlined here completely alleviates the need for Redux, and
    prop-drilling, while scaling well up to extremely complex front-ends with
    many interconnected, distant components. To pass state from one "side" to
    another lift it up to the nearest parent.
  </p>
  <p>
    RenderProps are simply functions that allow all of our components to be
    declared in a single place. They are invoked from the calling component,
    with their definitions coming from the root component. Their logic can
    include if conditions, switches, and other complex logic because the outer
    scope is a regular JavaScript function. We use the return statements to
    strictly render HTML. To reiterate, in renderProp functions, our outer scope
    is not a return statement, like it would be in the second pseudo-code
    example above. It is common for React code to contain ternary and other
    operators in curly braces in return statements. This pattern avoids this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Children props allow us to wrap JavaScript components (children) in HTML,
    moving the HTML/CSS mostly out of the JavaScript logic. The basis of this
    idea comes from reading
    <a href="https://justjavascript.com/">Just JavaScript</a> by Dan Abramov,
    where he emphasizes the distinction between "code" and "data". This approach
    wants a hard separation between HTML/CSS, and the various steps included in
    rendering conditional components. By breaking the tangle apart, engineers
    can more easily work with our data by clearly seeing the separation between
    code that controls how a page looks (HTML/CSS), and the the logic that
    controls the flow of data around the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Context is also useful, and I mostly use it for state that doesn't change
    very much but is accessed by a large number of components. For example,
    whether a page is mobile or not, i.e. is being viewed in mobile, tablet or
    desktop dimensions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our example project uses it to store the API URL and deckID. Here's the
    entire root component:
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/reactcasino/8.png"
      height="1230"
      width="720"
      alt="reactcasino 8" />
    <p id="caption">Root Casino component</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    This approach means we can dive deeper into any single component to change
    HTML, CSS or JavaScript logic. And, importantly, we can see the entire
    structure of the page in one place.
